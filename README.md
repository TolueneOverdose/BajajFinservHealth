# Bajaj Finserv Health - Java Qualifier Challenge

This project is a Spring Boot application built to solve the Java Qualifier 1 challenge from Bajaj Finserv Health. The application is designed to run an automated workflow upon startup, interacting with a remote API to receive and submit a solution to a given SQL problem.



# Locating the Final JAR File
The mvn clean package command compiles the project and packages it into an executable .jar file (not a .tar file). This is the file required for submission.

You can find the final .jar file inside the target/ directory, located in the root of your project folder.
